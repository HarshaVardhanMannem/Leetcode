        "\n",
        "### Problem Understanding\n",
        "Find two numbers in the array that add up to the target and return their indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Two Pointer Concept with Hashmap Implementation\n",
        "**Time Complexity:** O(n) - single pass through the array  \n",
        "**Space Complexity:** O(n) - hash map stores at most n elements\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Idea:** We use a two-pointer approach conceptually, but implement it efficiently using a hashmap:\n",
        "- **Pointer 1 (Current)**: Iterates through the array one element at a time (index `i`)\n",
        "- **Pointer 2 (Complement)**: Stored in hashmap, pointing to previously seen numbers that could be complements\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of using two physical pointers that move through the array (which would require sorting), we use a hashmap to \"remember\" where we've seen potential complement values, effectively creating a virtual second pointer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
        "1. Create an empty hash map `numMap` to store `{number: index}` - this acts as our \"second pointer\" storage\n",
        "2. Use a single pointer `i` to iterate through the array (first pointer):\n",
        "   - For each number `nums[i]`, calculate what its complement should be: `complement = target - nums[i]`\n",
        "   - Check if the complement exists in the hashmap (checking if our \"second pointer\" has seen it)\n",
        "   - If found, we have our two pointers: return `[numMap[complement], i]`\n",
        "   - If not found, store current number and index in map for future complement checks\n",
        "3. The hashmap effectively allows us to \"look back\" at previous elements without a second loop\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Two-Pointer + Hashmap Approach Works:**\n",
        "- Traditional two pointers require sorted array (O(n log n) sorting)\n",
        "- Hashmap eliminates need for sorting by providing O(1) lookup for complements\n",
        "- We maintain two \"pointers\" conceptually: current element (via loop) and complement (via hashmap lookup)\n",
        "- Single pass efficiency: O(n) instead of O(n²) brute force\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Walkthrough:**\n",
        "- `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`\n",
        "- **Pointer 1 (i=0)**: `nums[0]=2`, complement=7, check hashmap (empty) → store `{2: 0}` in hashmap\n",
        "- **Pointer 1 (i=1)**: `nums[1]=7`, complement=2, check hashmap → found at index 0!\n",
        "- **Two pointers found**: `[0, 1]` → return ✓"
